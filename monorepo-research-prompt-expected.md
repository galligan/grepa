# Deep Research: TypeScript Monorepo Migration Strategy - pnpm vs Bun

## Research Objectives

This research should provide a comprehensive comparison of monorepo strategies for migrating a TypeScript project, with a focus on evaluating whether to enhance the existing pnpm setup or switch to Bun. The findings will inform a critical architectural decision that affects developer experience, build performance, publishing workflow, and long-term maintainability for a production codebase.

## Project Context

### Current Setup
- Single TypeScript package with strict mode enabled
- pnpm as package manager
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint for linting
- Husky for git hooks
- Changesets for versioning and publishing
- Solid developer experience that should be preserved

### Migration Goals
- Convert to monorepo with 6-8 interdependent packages
- Maintain or improve current developer experience
- Ensure proper TypeScript support across all packages
- Enable efficient npm publishing workflow
- Optimize build performance without sacrificing stability

## Research Questions

### Core Decision Framework
1. What are the key differences between pnpm workspaces and Bun workspaces for TypeScript monorepos?
2. How mature is Bun's ecosystem for production monorepo scenarios compared to pnpm?
3. What are the migration paths and associated risks for each approach?

### Technical Evaluation
4. How do pnpm and Bun compare for:
   - TypeScript compilation and type checking across packages
   - Declaration file generation for npm publishing
   - Dependency resolution for interdependent packages
   - Build performance at scale (6-8 packages)
   - Hot module replacement and development experience

### Tooling Compatibility
5. How well do existing tools integrate with each approach:
   - Vitest compatibility and performance
   - ESLint integration
   - Husky/git hooks support
   - Changesets or alternative versioning strategies
   - CI/CD pipeline considerations

### Production Readiness
6. What are the real-world experiences of teams using Bun for production monorepos?
7. What are the common pitfalls and solutions for each approach?
8. How do they handle edge cases like circular dependencies or complex build graphs?

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Must support TypeScript strict mode across all packages
- Must generate proper .d.ts files for npm publishing
- Must handle complex interdependencies between packages
- Must maintain or improve current build times
- Must support incremental builds and caching

### Developer Experience Requirements
- Minimal disruption to existing workflows
- Clear error messages and debugging capabilities
- Fast feedback loops during development
- Seamless IDE integration (TypeScript language server)
- Easy onboarding for new team members

### Publishing Requirements
- Support for independent or synchronized package versioning
- Automated changelog generation
- NPM publishing workflow that handles dependencies correctly
- Version bumping across interdependent packages

## Research Scope

### Include
- Performance benchmarks for real-world TypeScript projects
- Migration guides and best practices
- Community adoption trends and ecosystem maturity
- Tool compatibility matrices
- Case studies from similar migrations

### Exclude
- General monorepo benefits (assume this decision is made)
- Non-TypeScript specific considerations
- Alternative tools beyond pnpm and Bun (unless briefly for context)

## Deliverable Format

Please provide a comprehensive analysis with:

### Executive Summary
- Clear recommendation with confidence level
- Key decision factors summarized
- Risk assessment overview
- Timeline implications

### Comparative Analysis
- Feature-by-feature comparison table
- Performance benchmarks with specific scenarios

- Migration complexity evaluation

### Tool-Specific Deep Dives

#### pnpm Workspaces Enhancement Path
- Current capabilities and limitations
- Required configuration changes
- Integration points with existing tooling
- Performance optimization strategies

#### Bun Migration Path
- Migration strategy and phases
- Tool replacement mapping
- Compatibility layer requirements
- Fallback strategies

### Implementation Recommendations
- Recommended approach with justification
- Step-by-step migration plan
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and checkpoints

### Technical Reference
- Configuration examples for both approaches
- Common patterns for interdependent packages
- Build optimization techniques
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Success Criteria

The research should:

1. Provide a clear, justified recommendation backed by evidence
2. Include concrete performance comparisons with similar project structures
3. Address all existing tooling with migration paths or alternatives
4. Identify and propose solutions for potential blockers
5. Offer a realistic timeline and resource assessment
6. Include fallback strategies if the chosen approach encounters issues
