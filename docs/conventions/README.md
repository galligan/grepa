# Grep-Anchor Conventions
<!-- :ga:tldr Standard patterns and practices for grep-anchors -->
<!-- :ga:convention Central hub for all grep-anchor conventions -->

Patterns and practices for making your codebase AI-navigable and human-friendly.

## Quick Start

Begin with these five essential patterns:

1. `:ga:todo` - Work that needs doing
2. `:ga:context` - Important assumptions or constraints
3. `:ga:security` - Security-critical code
4. `:ga:@agent` - AI agent instructions
5. `:ga:temp` - Temporary code to remove

That's it! You can search all of these with `rg ":ga:"`.

## Convention Categories

### [Common Patterns](./common-patterns.md)
Start here. Core patterns that work in any codebase.

### [AI Patterns](./ai-patterns.md)
Patterns for delegating work to AI agents and providing them context.

### [Progressive Enhancement Guide](../guides/progressive-enhancement.md)
How to adopt grep-anchors incrementally, from simple to advanced.

### [Custom Anchors Guide](../guides/custom-anchors.md)
How to define your own anchor pattern (if not using `:ga:`).

### [Advanced Patterns](../advanced-patterns.md)
JSON payloads, complex metadata, and sophisticated workflows.

### [Domain-Specific](./domain-specific.md)
Patterns for specific domains: web, mobile, DevOps, data science.

### [Workflow Patterns](./workflow-patterns.md)
Patterns for code review, deployment, and team processes.

## Core Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 3-5 patterns, expand as needed
2. **AI-First**: Design patterns that help AI agents navigate and understand
3. **Grepability**: Every pattern must be easily searchable
4. **Flexibility**: Teams should define their own vocabulary
5. **Progressive**: Add complexity only when it provides value

## Adoption Path

```
Level 0: Try one pattern (:ga:todo)
   ↓
Level 1: Enhance existing TODOs (TODO :ga:)
   ↓
Level 2: Add context (:ga:context)
   ↓
Level 3: Delegate to AI (:ga:@agent)
   ↓
Level 4: Link to issues (:ga:issue(123))
   ↓
Level 5: Team-specific patterns
```

## Remember

The goal is **discoverability**, not perfection. Even one `:ga:` marker makes your codebase more navigable than none.
