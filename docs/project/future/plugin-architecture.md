# Plugin Architecture as Configuration Bundles

<!-- :ga:tldr future plugin system design for workflow standardization -->
<!-- :ga:meta speculative architecture document moved from implementation plan -->

> **Future Feature**: This document outlines a speculative plugin architecture system that may be implemented in future versions of grepa. It is not part of the current specification.

## Overview

<!-- :ga:arch pattern package system without external dependencies -->
### Pattern Packages for Workflow Standardization

Plugins as configuration bundles that set up conventions, templates, aliases, and patterns for specific workflows without external dependencies.

## Plugin Examples

**Issue Tracking Plugin Example:**
```yaml
# @grepa/issues plugin
name: "@grepa/issues"
description: "Issue tracking patterns for internal documentation"

templates:
  issue: "issue,id:$1,status:$status ?? open,owner:$owner ?? @unclaimed"
  bug: "issue,type:bug,priority:$priority ?? medium,id:$1"
  task: "issue,type:task,epic:$epic,id:$1"

directories:
  create: ["docs/issues/", "docs/specs/", "docs/decisions/"]

aliases:
  bug: "issue,type:bug"
  enhancement: "issue,type:enhancement"
  epic: "issue,type:epic"

search-shortcuts:
  open-issues: ["status:open", "status:in-progress"]
  my-issues: ["owner:$user"]
  bugs: ["type:bug"]
```

**Monorepo Service Plugin Example:**
```yaml
# @grepa/monorepo plugin
name: "@grepa/monorepo"
description: "Service-oriented monorepo patterns"

templates:
  service-todo: "todo,service:$1,team:$team ?? @unclaimed"
  service-config: "config,service:$1,env:$env ?? dev"
  cross-service: "rel(depends:$1),service:$2"

search-shortcuts:
  auth-service: ["service:auth", "repo:services/auth-*", "#auth"]
  payment-service: ["service:payment", "repo:services/payment-*", "#payment"]

service-mapping:
  auth: { directory: "services/auth-service", team: "@auth-team" }
  payment: { directory: "services/payment-service", team: "@payments-team" }
```

**AI Agent Plugin Example:**
```yaml
# @grepa/ai-agents plugin
name: "@grepa/ai-agents"
description: "AI agent interaction patterns"

templates:
  claude-task: "@claude($1),priority:$priority ?? medium"
  claude-review: "@claude(review:$1),type:code-review"
  cursor-implement: "@cursor(implement:$1),complexity:$complexity ?? medium"

aliases:
  ai-help: "@claude"
  code-review: "@claude(review)"
  auto-implement: "@cursor(implement)"

agent-patterns:
  "@claude": { description: "Claude AI tasks", triggers: ["review", "implement", "explain"] }
  "@cursor": { description: "Cursor AI tasks", triggers: ["implement", "refactor", "test"] }
```

<!-- :ga:benefit plugin system advantages for team standardization -->
## Plugin Benefits

1. **No External Dependencies** - Pure configuration, no API calls
2. **Pattern Standardization** - Teams share conventions via plugins
3. **Gradual Adoption** - Start simple, add workflow plugins as needed
4. **Customizable** - Teams can fork/modify for specific needs
5. **Composable** - Multiple plugins work together
6. **Discoverable** - Plugin registry for common patterns

## Implementation Considerations

<!-- :ga:todo future implementation requirements -->
- Plugin loading and configuration system
- Template interpolation engine
- Alias resolution system
- Search shortcut definitions
- Plugin registry and distribution
- Version compatibility management
