# Grepa CLI – Changelog

> [!INFO]
> The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and adheres to semantic versioning for the spec itself (independent of the grepa tooling version).

All notable changes to the **Grepa tooling** will be documented in this file.  The versioning here refers to the CLI / libraries themselves, independent of the Magic-Anchor language spec (see `../magic-anchors/CHANGELOG.md`).
